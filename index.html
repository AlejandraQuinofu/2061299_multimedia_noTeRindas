            <p>We are a small group of students from the SENA, of which we have created a campaign that seeks to raise
                awareness in the youth of the 11th grade of Kennedy School, between the ages of 17 and 18, raising
                awareness of the problems that cause dependency and excess of drugs, this is directed; either for young
                consumers or non-consumers and relatives or close people who are affected with this problem.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="2">Objective</h2>
        <div class="parrafo">
            <p>Faced with the problem presented by excessive drug use in adolescents at the Kennedy School in Medellín,
                which is generating low performance in their grades, family and social problems, internal conflicts of
                young people and the non-acceptance of them, our campaign project "Do not give up", seeks to create a
                culture in young people, family members and people around who are affected by the use of drugs and
                become aware that they do not need them to solve problems or be fashionable and make people aware that
                have similar problems and feel affected.</p>
            <p>With this we seek to improve the academic performance of young people, achieve a better family and social
                environment, acceptance of themselves, inform and sensitize young people about the importance of not
                depending on drugs. Making them see how this can have great consequences for their quality of life.</p>
